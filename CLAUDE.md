## Current Status (Updated: 2026-01-30)
- Project created via Otterly Project Manager
- Initial scaffold generated

## Key Features
- [ ] (Add your planned features here)

## User Preferences
These preferences are aggregated from existing projects and represent how
the project owner works:

- Design philosophy: minimal, functional, clean
- The user is a "vibe coder" - they describe what they want, Claude writes the code
- The user has limited memory - this CLAUDE.md file is the single source of truth
- Always read this file FIRST when starting a new Claude Code session
- Keep this file updated after every significant change
- When in doubt about the project state, re-read this file

## Workflow Rules
- After every successful change, remind the user to commit to git before starting the next task
- Do not start a new feature until the previous change is committed
- If a new feature causes a bug, debug it properly - do NOT revert without explicit approval
- Always push to origin after every commit
- For bug fixes: do NOT push until user confirms the fix works
- Git commit messages should be short, descriptive, and in present tense
- Keep the code clean and well-organized
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

## Development Context
This project was scaffolded by Otterly Project Manager on 2026-01-30.

Read this file FIRST when starting a new session.
